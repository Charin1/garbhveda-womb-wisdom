Implement Dad Mode (Pitra-Yoga)
Goal Description
Integrate a "Dad Mode" into the GarbhVeda application to involve the father in the pregnancy journey. This includes a dedicated dashboard, specific activities (Pitra Vani, Kick Game, Seva Tracker, etc.), and a role-switching mechanism.

User Review Required
IMPORTANT

Data Persistence: For the "Promise Vault" and "Pitra Vani" audio recordings, we will use IndexedDB (via a library like idb-keyval) to store audio blobs locally as localStorage has size limits. This means data is local to the device/browser. Jokes API: We will use https://icanhazdadjoke.com/ for the Dad Joke generator.
